# 100-days-of-code
Daily practice and notes while learning software development
## Why I started 
I started this challenge to build strong fundamentals in computer science and software development.
This repository is meant to help me stay consistent, disciplined, and improve my understanding step by step through regular practice and learning.

## What I Aim to Achieve
- Master JavaScript from basics to advanced
- Build strong problem-solving skills using Data Structures and Algorithms
- Become confident in MERN Stack development
- Understand how AI works from basic concepts to deeper layers
- Build small projects and document my learning clearly

## Rules I Follow
- Code or study regularly (avoid long gaps)
- Focus on understanding, not just completing tasks
- Write daily progress honestly
- Improve step by step without pressure


# Daily Progress Log

### Day 1
- Learned basics of time and space complexity
- Understood Big O notation and common complexities
- Studied best, worst, and average case scenarios
- Solved basic array problems (find max, reverse array)
- Analyzed time and space complexity for each solution
